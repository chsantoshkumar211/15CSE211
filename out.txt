The topological sort of the first graph is: 
A 1
B 2
C 5
D 4
E 3
F 7
G 6

Shortest paths from vertex A of graph 2:
Shortest path from A to A is 0
Shortest path from A to B is 2
Shortest path from A to C is 3
Shortest path from A to D is 1
Shortest path from A to E is 3
Shortest path from A to F is 6
Shortest path from A to G is 5
